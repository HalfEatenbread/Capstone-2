            Tetris is a classic puzzle video game that has captivated players since its inception. Here’s a brief history of Tetris
            , from its creation to the present day:
         </p>
         <br><br>
         <h3>
            1. Creation (1984-1985):
         </h3>
         <br>
         <p>
            - Tetris was created by Alexey Pajitnov, a Soviet software engineer, while he was working at the Dorodnitsyn Computing
            Centre of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow. <br>
            - The first version was developed on an Electronika 60 computer and was inspired by a puzzle game called Pentominoes.
         </p>
         <br><br>
         <h3>
            2. Initial Release (1985):
         </h3>
         <br>
         <p>- The game was officially released on June 6, 1985, and quickly gained popularity within the Soviet Union.</p>

         </h3>
         <br>
         <p>
            - Tetris made its way to the West in the late 1980s, thanks to various software developers who ported it to different
            platforms, including the IBM PC and the Commodore 64.<br>
            - The game’s addictive nature led to its widespread acclaim and numerous adaptations.
         </p>
         <br><br>
         <h3>
            4. Game Boy Launch (1989):
         </h3>
         <br>
         <p>
            - The release of the Nintendo Game Boy in 1989 included Tetris as a pack-in game, which significantly boosted its
            popularity and introduced it to a broader audience.<br>

         </p>

         </h3>
         <br>
         <p>
            - The success of Tetris led to various legal disputes over licensing rights, particularly between Pajitnov and several
            companies that had developed versions of the game.<br>
            - In 1996, Pajitnov finally gained the rights to Tetris, and he co-founded The Tetris Company to manage the game's
            licensing.
         </p>
         <br><br>

            - Tetris has continued to evolve with technology, appearing on numerous platforms, including mobile devices, consoles,
            and PCs.<br>
            - The game has seen various iterations, including Tetris 99, a battle royale version released in 2019, which has been
            well-received by both new and veteran players.<br>
            - Tetris remains a cultural icon, celebrated for its simple yet challenging gameplay, and it continues to be featured
            in competitive gaming events.
         </p>
         <br><br>
         <h3>
            7. Current Developments:

            <li><a href="https://liquipedia.net/tetris/Blue_scuti">Willis Gibson</a>, a 13-year-old from Oklahoma, has made
               history by becoming the first person believed to have ever completed the original Nintendo version of Tetris. 
               This remarkable achievement comes nearly 40 years after the game's release, a feat that many players thought was
               impossible. Gibson's record-setting playthrough lasted around 39 minutes, during which he reached an unprecedented
               level of 157. This level is particularly significant because it is known to cause the game to crash, highlighting
               the extraordinary skill and precision required to achieve it.</li>
